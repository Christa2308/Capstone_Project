### Overview
This project contains a Power BI report and related resources analyzing patterns in public transport trips and passenger distribution across cities and years using data analytics and visualization. 
1. We clean the Dataset,
 Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers,

 Apply necessary data transformations (e.g., encoding, scaling)

2. We conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Generate descriptive statistics

3. Visualize distributions and relationships among variables

4. Apply a Machine Learning or Clustering Model
Choose a suitable model (classification, regression, or clustering),
Train the model on your dataset

6. Evaluate the model

7. Add innovation
I added a function that I would recommend for the best route

### POWERBI TASKS
This project involves the creation and analysis of interactive dashboards using Power BI — a powerful business intelligence tool used to visualize data and generate insights. 
The main objective of this task is to transform raw data into meaningful visual reports that help users understand patterns, trends, and key metrics at a glance.

**1. On the top left corner, we have  KPIs (Cards):**
Total Number of Trips 

Total Number of Passengers which communicate headline statistics.

Then follows 

**2. Line Charts:**
Trips and Passengers Over Time (Yearly Trends) X-Axis: Year 

Y-Axis: Total Trips or Passengers 

Shows whether usage is increasing or decreasing over time.

**3. Total Passengers by Year (Top Left):**
What it shows: The total number of passengers grouped by year. 

Observation: Each year from 2018 to 2023 accounts for 63.28M passengers (16.7%), which  means: 
Either your data is uniformly distributed across years. 
 
**4.  Total Passengers by Cluster (Top Middle):**
What it shows: Distribution of passengers across the clusters generated by your machine learning model (KMeans).

**5. Passengers per Trip by City_Makkah (Top Right):**
What it shows: Average passengers per trip, filtered specifically for city_Makkah. 

Observation: 
66.8% is in category 1.
3.2% in category 0.

**6. Total Trips by City_Jeddah (Bar Chart):** 
Visual Type: Bar chart with "Increase", "Decrease", "Total" categories, 

What it shows: 
Trip totals for Jeddah segmented into increasing, decreasing, and total categories. 

One bar shows 6.2M trips in total. 

**7. Total Passengers by Month and Day (Bar Chart):**
Visual Type: Vertical bar chart 

What it shows: Number of passengers for each day in July (10–15).

**8. Decomposition Tree for Total Trips**
Visual Type: Decomposition tree 

What it shows:  
Starting from Total Trips (6.2M),

Broken down by:  
Year (2018–2021) 
city_Riyadh (binary flag 1/0) 
region_Riyadh (binary flag 1/0) 
route (individual route IDs)
