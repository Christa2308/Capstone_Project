### Overview
This project contains a Power BI report and related resources analyzing patterns in public transport trips and passenger distribution across cities and years using data analytics and visualization. 
1. We clean the Dataset,
 Handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers,

 Apply necessary data transformations (e.g., encoding, scaling)

3. We conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Generate descriptive statistics

4. Visualize distributions and relationships among variables

4. Apply a Machine Learning or Clustering Model
▪ Choose a suitable model (classification, regression, or clustering),
 Train the model on your dataset

5. Evaluate the model

6. Add innovation
I added a function that I would recommend for the best route

### POWERBI TASKS
This project involves the creation and analysis of interactive dashboards using Power BI — a powerful business intelligence tool used to visualize data and generate insights. 
The main objective of this task is to transform raw data into meaningful visual reports that help users understand patterns, trends, and key metrics at a glance.

On the top left corner,we have  KPIs (Cards)
Total Number of Trips 
Total Number of Passengers which communicate headline statistics.

Then follows  Line Charts
Trips and Passengers Over Time (Yearly Trends) X-Axis: Year 
Y-Axis: Total Trips or Passengers 
Shows whether usage is increasing or decreasing over time.

1. Total Passengers by Year (Top Left)
What it shows: The total number of passengers grouped by year. 
Observation: Each year from 2018 to 2023 accounts for 63.28M passengers (16.7%), which  means: 
Either your data is uniformly distributed across years.
